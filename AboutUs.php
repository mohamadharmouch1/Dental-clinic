                <p>
                    Dental braces are devices used in 
                    othrodontics that align and straighten teeth and help position 
                    them with regard to a person's bite, while also aiming to improve 
                    dental health.
                    </br></br>
                    Braces will straighten your teeth, fix bite issues and improve the 
                    overall appearance of your smile. Best of all dental braces give you 
                    results that last a lifetime.
                    </br></br>
                    However, a general rule of thumb is your kids should at getting braces between the age
                    of 9 and 14. Usually this is before they've gone through puberty. If they've already gone through it 
                    this means it'll be harder to adjust their jaw and/or teeth, as they've already settled into their 
                    post-puberty postions.

                        Dental Implant Surgery
                </h2>
                <p>
                   Dental implant surgery is a procedure that replaces tooth roots with metal, screwlike posts
                   and replaces damaged or missing teeth that look and functionmuch like real ones. Dental
                   implant surgery can offer a welcome alternative to dentures or bridgework that doesn't fit well
                   and can offer an option when a lack of natural teeth roots don't allow building denture 
                   or birdgework tooth replacements.</br></br>
                   How dental implant surgery is performed depends on the type of implant and the condition
                   of your jawbone. Dental implant surgery may involve several procedures.
                   The major benefit of implants is solid support for your new teeth â€” a process 
                   that requires the bone to heal tightly around the implant.
                   Because this bone healing requires time, the process can take many months. </br></br>

                    Root Canal Treatment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Root canal treatment (endodontics) is a dental procedure used to treat infection at the centre of a tooth.
                    Root canal treatment is not painful and can save a tooth that might otherwise have to be removed completely.
                    </br></br>
                    While all general dentists have been trained in root canals, more often than not the
                    procedure is done by an endodontist. Generally speaking, a dentist specializes in exterior teeth and gum health,
                    an endodontist specializes in the health of the inside of the tooth.</br></br>
